//! The M3 engine: plan, re-evaluate, stop propagation, explain.
//!
//! Two entry points, and the difference between them is structural rather than
//! a promise.
//!
//! `full_recompute` is the oracle. It receives a snapshot and a target list. It
//! has no parameter through which an `EvaluationRecord`, an index or an
//! invalidation function could arrive, so it cannot call the incremental
//! strategy even by accident.
//!
//! `revise` is the incremental path. It decides reuse from the recorded read set
//! before running anything, so a consumer whose consumed facets did not move is
//! not re-evaluated at all.
//!
//! Reuse refreshes no evidence by magic. Content can be identical while its
//! provenance, its UNI evidence, its availability or its authority condition has
//! moved, which is why a node can be `reusable` on content and still carry an
//! obligation.
